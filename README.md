# World-University-Rankings-Clustering
This was a school project in which my partner and I used Heirarchical clustering and k-means clustering in order to group world university ranking data.

The implementations are in heirarchicalcluster.py and kmeans.py, with some helper functions defined in unsupervisedLearning.py.  The rest of the files were mainly storing data to be analyzed.
